# Finbot - A Fintech Chatbot
## Description
Finbot is a chatbot that offers tailored financial advice and services to users based on their needs. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to understand user intents and provide personalized responses.

The project consists of two main files:

- train_chatbot.py: This script reads a set of pre-defined intents from a JSON file, preprocesses the text data, trains a neural network model using TensorFlow, and saves the trained model to a file.
- chatbot.py: This script loads the trained model and runs a loop to continuously prompt the user for input and generate responses using the chatbot.

## Installation and Usage
To use the chatbot, you can simply run the chatbot.py script and start interacting with it via the command line interface. Before running the chatbot, you will need to first train the model by running the train_chatbot.py script.
